# Project Options and Suggestions

## Project List

Teams will need to pick a project subject.  The project scope can be from existing work you have done in class or work you are doing on research projects currently.  The scope must be something that 5 people can contribute equally to over the course of 15 weeks and is not expected to 100% feature complete, but must be re-deployable and usable in all phases.

Here are some suggestions to get you started
