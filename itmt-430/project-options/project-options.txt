Project Options and Suggestions
===============================

Project List
------------

Teams will need to pick a project subject. The project scope can be from
existing work you have done in classes or work you are doing on research
projects currently. The scope must be something that 5 people can
contribute equally to over the course of 15 weeks and is not expected to
100% feature complete, but must be re-deployable and usable in all
phases.

Suggested Outlines
------------------

-   Bug Overflow Q & A
    -   Create a near feature complete copy of Stackoverflow Q&A site
    -   Instead of tech based Q & A, this will be based on identifying
        various types of insects
    -   Create user accounts and profile post questions, images, and
        answers
    -   Up and Down vote questions, track user points
    -   Create storage solution for photos
-   Project Factor
    -   Create a system allowing users to create accounts and upload
        video, using a speech to text library (cloud based or
        opensource) to create text transcripts of these videos
    -   Include solution for storage of videos and cost justification
    -   Using a Hadoop/Solr/Lucene based application create an search
        engine to allow for searching of phrases and correlation with
        timestamp index in the corresponding video
-   Flickr/Instagram hybrid internal photo search site
    -   Create a flicker like tagged photo system allowing employees to
        search and modify stock photos (I will provide the photos to
        you)
    -   Analyze realtime image rendering vs storing pre-rendered images
    -   Create storage solution for images
-   Autonomous Drone Movement Framework Management Console
    -   Interface with PixHawk based UAVs via
        [Dronekit.io](https://dronekit.io "Dronekit.io webpage")
    -   Create a system for autonomously querying and ordering UAVs
    -   Create a software package for installation and create backend
        for storage of inflight telemetry
-   Virtual Reality (VR) based Networking Lab
    -   Creating a VR based application that would be a self-contained
        network routing and switching app
    -   Create visual demonstrations (lectures)
    -   Create hands on networking and switching exercises to allow for
        virtual "hands-on" exercises
    -   Using a small physical switching and routing setup, create a
        bridge to allow the virtual configuration to be applied in real
        life.
-   Create and AI assistant for College Classes
    -   Google Home, Amazon Echo, and or OpenSource Mycroft based
        assistant
    -   Coordinate department syllabi to be injected into application
        (will be provided)
    -   Create voice syntax for querying via voice and receiving spoken
        responses
    -   Focus on VI/VX (voice interface, voice experience) to make the
        service as friendly as possible
-   Create a functioning PaaS using [Red Hat OpenShift
    project](https://www.openshift.com/ "Red Hat OpenShift")
    -   Prototype the initial setup
    -   Implement the initial setup on department provided hardware
    -   Re-implement several projects from previous semesters as proof
        of concepts (code will be provided)
-   Other student defined projects
