Two person team selects the book chapter they will present.  You are to read the chapter and create a PowerPoint Presentation covering the content of the chapter(s).   At the conclusion of the presentation you need to include 3 review questions, 4 review questions if you cover more than 1 chapter.

Time limit is 10 minutes exactly.  Come ahead of time prepared for the presentation to start right away.  All team members need to talk during the event.
