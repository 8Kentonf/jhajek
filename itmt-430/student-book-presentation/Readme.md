# Student Book Presentation

With a partner from any section, sign up for a chapter presentation at this link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d7Ikk55tvTuV_XV1vb8sSt06jn3kEMUBKMsXWi4lUHw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d7Ikk55tvTuV_XV1vb8sSt06jn3kEMUBKMsXWi4lUHw/edit?usp=sharing "Google doc sign up link").  

Two person team selects the book chapter they will present.  You are to read the chapter and create a PowerPoint Presentation covering the content of the chapter(s).   At the conclusion of the presentation you need to include at least 4 review questions and no more than 8; per chapter you cover, if you cover beyond 1 chapter.

## Video Presentation

Time limit is 10 minutes minimum and 15 minutes maximum.  It will be played on the day on your presentation at the scheduled time by me.  All team members need to talk and present.

I would recommend using screen recording software such as [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/ "OBS project home page"), which is an opensource screen capture tool, it is used mainly by podcasters and works well to capture video and audio.  [Openshot](https://www.openshot.org/ "openshot opensource video editor") is a free and opensource video editor and could be a good option to splice two recordings together to make a single presentation.  Another option would be to enter a zoom meeting and use the "Record Meeting" option.  The are many other tools you can use -- these are my suggestions.

From these questions I will draw the material for the Final Exam.

## Grading

The presentation is worth 10 points (per team member - group grade).
