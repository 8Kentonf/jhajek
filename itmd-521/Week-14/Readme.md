## Week 14 Chain Mapper and Pig Assignment

### Objectives 

* Understand how to write and use Pig Latin on an HDFS cluster
* Compare the execution time of MapReduce and Pig script 
* Understand the concept of chain mappers and how they optimize processing of MR jobs 

### Outcomes 

At the conclusion of this lab you will have an undedrstanding of writing and deploying Pig Latin scripts on an HDFS cluster and will be able to compare their execution to that of MapReduce.  You also will be able to undesrtadn the optimizations of using chain mappers on MR job execution.

### Part I

Using the dataset on the Remote HDFS cluster we have been using this semester:

* A-E 80/80.txt 
* F-R 90/90.txt 
* S-Z 60-70/60-70.txt 

Write a map class 

Provide the code and logic for a pig script (or grunt) containing your initials in the job name field.  This script should find the max  

### Deliverable 1

Submit your Github repo URL to blackboard by 11:59 pm April 19th.

In your Week-13 folder include all scripts and program instructions needed to retrieve and reproduce your results.  Upload your part-r-0000 file (results) as well)  Write and instruction/assumptions needed in the Assumption section below.
