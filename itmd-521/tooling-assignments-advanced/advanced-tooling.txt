Tolling Assignment Advanced
===========================

Objectives and Outcomes
-----------------------

-   Understand how to add custom virtual machines to the Vagrant
    platform
-   Understand the advantages of using Vagrant and Packer
-   Configure specific software needed to use Big Data tooling platform,
    Spark, Hadoop, and Mariadb in virtual machines

Packer and Vagrant Build Steps
------------------------------

-   From the commandline, `cd` into the build directory of the
    packer-vagrant-build-scripts repo you cloned.
    -   `packer-vagrant-build-scripts\packer\build`
-   Find the build artifacts, there should be one \*.box file, similar
    to `ubuntu-vanilla-18043-server-virtualbox-1580565828.box`
    -   Your number will be different as it is a timestamp
-   Add this box to Vagrant
    -   Initialize and connect to this virtual machine.

Inside Vagrant Box Steps
------------------------

-   Change host name, add initials and system for local
-   Install mariadb server
-   Install java 8 openjdk
    -   make sure it is default jdk
-   Install Spark 2.4
    -   <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/spark/spark-2.4.4/spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz>
-   Install Hadoop 2.9.2
    -   <http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.9.2/hadoop-2.9.2.tar.gz>
-   Configure `.bashrc` file to add path
    -   Demonstrate installation success with `--version` commands
-   Configure Vagrant paths, memory, and cpus

Deliverable
-----------

-   Proceed to finish the last part of chapter 2 lecture
    -   Walking through the command line Spark exercises
