## Six Core Data Sources

- [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "CSV Wikipedia Page Link")
  - A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values.
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html "JSON.org website")
  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers
- [Parquet](http://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/ "Parquet file format description web page")
  - Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model or programming language.
  - [Columnar Storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS "columnar storage")
- [ORC](https://orc.apache.org/ "Apache ORC project page")
  - The smallest, fastest columnar storage for Hadoop workloads.
- [JDBC/ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity "ODBC wikipedia description page")
  - Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems (DBMS)
- Plain-Text files
  - Simplest and most universal data format, also the slowest and most inefficient.
